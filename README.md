This is a tiny Nuxt.js application, which uses [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to visualize characters and episodes from Rick & Morty TV show.

The Rick and Morty API is a RESTful and GraphQL API based on the television show Rick and Morty. 
It provides access to hundreds of characters, images, locations and episodes.

The app is automatically built and deployed to the Digital Ocean using CircleCI integration with Github.
